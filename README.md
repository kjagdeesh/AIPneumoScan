# üß† Project Overview: AI PneumoScan ‚Äì AI-powered Pneumonia Detection App

<img src="https://github.com/kjagdeesh/AIPneumoScan/blob/master/maui_mobile_app/AIPneumoScan/Resources/Images/ic_logo.png" width=300/><br><br>

**AI PneumoScan** is a modern, AI-driven mobile application designed to assist with early detection of pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Built with a hybrid technology stack that includes **.NET MAUI for the cross-platform frontend** and **Python for model training and inference,** it combines the power of deep learning with the convenience of offline mobile deployment.

The project leverages a **fine-tuned ResNet50 convolutional neural network**, trained on the popular **Chest X-Ray Pneumonia dataset** from Kaggle, to classify X-ray images as either **NORMAL** or **PNEUMONIA**. The trained model is exported to the **ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)** format, which is then used within the MAUI app via **ONNX Runtime for .NET** for fast, offline predictions.

Unlike cloud-based solutions, AI PneumoScan performs all predictions **locally on-device**, ensuring **privacy, security,** and **instant results** even in offline environments. It's ideal for educational use, fieldwork, rural healthcare training simulations, or low-resource settings where internet access is unreliable.

## üì¶ Dataset (Required)

This project uses the **Chest X-Ray Pneumonia** dataset available on Kaggle:

üîó [Download Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)

After downloading:

1. Extract the dataset.
2. Place the `chest_xray/` folder **inside the `training/` directory**.
3. The final path should look like: `training/chest_xray/train/NORMAL/`, etc.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Python Model Training & Prediction

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install torch torchvision scikit-learn numpy onnxruntime
```

### 2. Train and Export ONNX Model

```bash
cd training
python train_and_export.py
```

This script:

- Loads the `chest_xray` dataset with augmentations
- Trains a ResNet50 model with validation accuracy output
- Saves model to `pneumonia_model.pth`
- Exports to `pneumonia_model.onnx`

### 3. Run Prediction with Care Suggestion (Optional)

```bash
python predict_with_care.py chest_xray/test/PNEUMONIA/person120_bacteria_573.jpeg
```

Output example:

```
Prediction: PNEUMONIA (95%)
Care Suggestion: Seek immediate medical attention.
```

## üì± MAUI App Setup

### 1. Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022+ with MAUI workload
- .NET 8 or higher

### 2. Build & Run

- Open `AIPneumoScan.sln`
- Run on Android/iOS/emulator

### 3. ONNX Model

Ensure `pneumonia_model.onnx` is added to `.csproj` as:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <Content Include="Resources\Raw\pneumonia_model.onnx">
	    <CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>
	</Content>
</ItemGroup>
```

The app uses `InferenceSession` to load this model and return predictions.

Optional SQLite database for personalized recommendations.

Schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE CareInfo (
  label TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  suggestion TEXT
